# Evidence-backed 5-step routines by goal

Practical morning/evening routines to plug into onboarding flows. Steps are short, habit-friendly, and grounded in public guidance (CDC, WHO, AASM, APA, ACSM, AHA, NIH, BJSM). Timings are typical ranges; adjust for user constraints or medical advice.

## Goal: Get fitter

**Morning (5 steps)**
1) 5–10 min light mobility (neck/hips/ankles) immediately after waking — primes joints and circulation, lowers injury risk before workouts (ACSM, BJSM).  
2) 8–16 oz water, optional light protein (10–20 g) — rehydrates after sleep; protein supports muscle repair (AHA hydration guidance, NIH protein meta-analyses).  
3) 10–20 min brisk walk or easy cardio — builds toward 150+ min/wk moderate activity (CDC/WHO Physical Activity Guidelines).  
4) 2–3 strength moves, 1–2 sets (push/pull/squat/hinge/core) — frequency beats volume for adherence; supports muscle/ bone health (ACSM).  
5) 1–2 min plan session (when/what to train next) — implementation intentions improve exercise follow-through (health behavior research).

**Evening (5 steps)**
1) Light stretching/foam roll 5–10 min — aids recovery and flexibility (ACSM).  
2) Prep workout clothes/bag and water bottle — reduces friction and decision load (habit-formation research).  
3) Protein-forward dinner/snack (20–40 g total protein before bed) — supports overnight muscle protein synthesis (NIH/ISSA summaries).  
4) 5–10 min wind-down walk or gentle mobility — low-intensity movement can reduce soreness and improve sleep onset (AASM notes on light activity).  
5) Sleep target set (7–9 h) with consistent bedtime alarm — sleep consistency improves performance and recovery (AASM).

## Goal: Sleep better

**Morning (5 steps)**
1) Bright light within 30–60 min of waking for 10–20 min — anchors circadian rhythm (AASM, NIDDK).  
2) 5–10 min gentle movement or walk — raises core temp and energy, strengthens circadian cues (AASM).  
3) Caffeine after ~60–90 min awake; cap total and avoid late afternoon — reduces afternoon crashes and sleep disruption (AASM sleep hygiene guidance).  
4) Regular breakfast with protein/fiber — stabilizes glucose and circadian timing of metabolism (NIH nutrition/sleep research).  
5) Set “last caffeine” time (6–8 h before bed) and “last big meal” (3+ h before bed) — lowers sleep onset latency (AASM).

**Evening (5 steps)**
1) 30–60 min pre-bed wind-down (dim lights, screens to night mode) — reduces melatonin suppression (AASM).  
2) Warm shower/bath 60–90 min before bed — post-cooling helps sleep onset (systematic review in Sleep Medicine Reviews).  
3) 5–10 min journaling/next-day plan — offloads worries, reduces rumination (APA).  
4) No heavy exercise within 1–2 h of bed; allow ≥3 h after large meals — improves sleep efficiency (AASM).  
5) Bedroom cues: cool (~65–68°F/18–20°C), dark, quiet; reserve bed for sleep — classic sleep hygiene (AASM).

## Goal: Be more engaged/productive at work

**Morning (5 steps)**
1) 5 min intention setting: top 1–3 outcomes for the day — boosts focus and goal completion (implementation intention literature).  
2) 10–20 min movement (walk/mobility) — improves alertness and executive function (CDC activity → cognition links).  
3) Caffeine with protein/fiber breakfast — supports sustained attention; avoid high-sugar spikes (nutrition cognition studies).  
4) 60–90 min deep-work block early (no notifications) — protects peak alertness period (chronobiology and productivity research).  
5) Schedule 1–2 micro-breaks per hour (1–2 min stretch/eye rest) — reduces fatigue and maintains performance (ergonomics research).

**Evening (5 steps)**
1) 5–10 min shutdown ritual (review what was done, capture loose ends) — lowers work rumination (organizational psych).  
2) Set next-day priorities (top 3) — externalizes tasks, improves next-day initiation (productivity research).  
3) Light movement after work (10–20 min walk) — helps transition and stress recovery (APA stress management).  
4) Screen curfew or blue-light filter 60 min before bed — supports sleep quality and next-day alertness (AASM).  
5) Gratitude or wins list (3 items) — improves mood and reduces burnout risk (positive psychology studies).

## Goal: Reduce stress / boost mood (optional goal for onboarding breadth)

**Morning (5 steps)**
1) 5 min diaphragmatic breathing (4-6 breaths/min) — reduces sympathetic arousal (APA, NIH).  
2) 5–10 min light exercise — acute mood lift via endorphins (CDC).  
3) 5 min gratitude or values check — improves affect and motivation (positive psych).  
4) Hydrate and balanced breakfast — stabilizes energy and mood (NIH).  
5) Plan a social touchpoint (message or coffee) — social connection buffers stress (APA).

**Evening (5 steps)**
1) 5–10 min reflection journaling — aids emotion processing (APA).  
2) 10–20 min light movement or yoga — reduces cortisol and improves sleep (AASM/APA).  
3) Digital sunset: reduce news/social 60 min pre-bed — lowers arousal (AASM).  
4) Relaxation drill (box breathing/progressive relaxation 5–10 min) — improves HRV and calm (NIH/APA).  
5) Consistent sleep window — stabilizes mood and stress resilience (AASM).
