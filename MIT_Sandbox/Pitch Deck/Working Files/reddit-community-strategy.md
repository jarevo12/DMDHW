# Reddit Community Engagement Strategy

## Understanding "r/" - Reddit Subreddits

**r/** = **Reddit subreddit** (topic-based communities on reddit.com)

Reddit is a massive forum/discussion platform organized into thousands of communities called "subreddits." The "r/" prefix is how you reference them.

### Target Subreddits for Axiom Forge

| r/selfimprovement | 1.2M | Need science-backed approaches |

## How to Reach These Communities

### Phase 1: Research & Lurk (Week 1-2)

**Objective**: Understand the community before engaging

1. **Create Reddit account** (if you don't have one)
2. **Subscribe** to target subreddits
3. **Read daily** (30 min/day minimum):
   - Sort by "Hot" and "Top - This Week"
   - Read 20-30 posts to understand:
     - What problems people complain about
     - Community tone and culture
     - What content gets upvoted
     - Subreddit rules (in sidebar)

### Phase 2: Authentic Engagement (Week 3-4)

**Objective**: Build credibility through genuine helpfulness

1. **Comment on existing posts** (5-10/day)
   - Find posts where people express frustration
   - Example: "I can't stick to my morning routine"
   - Reply with genuine advice (NOT pitching your app yet)
   - Share behavioral science insights

2. **Build karma and credibility**
   - Helpful comments get upvoted
   - Users recognize your username
   - Establishes you as domain expert

### Phase 3: Value-First Content (Week 5-6)

**Objective**: Share solution after establishing trust

#### Good Post Examples:
- "I analyzed 100 productivity apps and found they all miss this one thing [behavioral science insights]"
- "Why habit trackers fail (and what actually works according to research)"
- "The psychology behind why New Year's resolutions die by February"

#### Bad Post Examples (Avoid):
- "Check out my new habit tracker app!"
- Direct product pitches without value
- Generic promotional content

#### Soft CTA (Call to Action):
After providing value, mention in comments or post footer:
- "I'm building something to solve this - happy to share beta access if interested"
- "DM me if you want early access to test this approach"
- Include link to landing page or signup form

## Subreddit Rules & Etiquette

### Common Rules to Watch For:
- **No self-promotion** (except on designated days like "Self-Promotion Sunday")
- **Minimum account age/karma** to post
- **No direct linking** to external sites in some subs
- **Flair requirements** (post tags)

### Best Practices:
1. **Read sidebar rules** before posting in each subreddit
2. **Check moderator announcements** pinned to top
3. **Look at successful posts** to understand what works
4. **Respond to every comment** on your posts

## Red Flags to Avoid

❌ **Don't spam** - Reddit users can smell marketing from miles away
❌ **Don't use new accounts to immediately promote** - looks like spam
❌ **Don't ignore downvotes** - if a post gets buried, take the hint and adjust
❌ **Don't cross-post the same promotional content** to multiple subs
❌ **Don't argue with moderators** - they can ban you permanently

## Conversion Funnel Strategy

### Awareness → Interest → Beta Signup

```
Lurk & Learn (Week 1-2)
    ↓
Comment Helpfully (Week 3-4)
    ↓
Create Value Post (Week 5)
    ↓
Soft CTA: "DM for beta access"
    ↓
Direct Message → Beta Signup Link
    ↓
Track Conversion: Signups → Active Users
```

### Expected Numbers (Conservative):
- **1 value post** with good reception: 50-200 upvotes
- **5-10% click-through** to beta signup: 3-15 signups per post
- **Across 5-8 subreddits**: 15-25 beta users from Reddit alone

## Axiom Forge's Unique Angle

**Your Differentiator**: Behavioral science foundation

### Content Themes to Lead With:
1. **Why habit trackers fail** (educate, don't pitch)
2. **The science of behavior change** (establish expertise)
3. **Common mistakes** in routine building (be helpful first)
4. **Real user struggles** you've observed (build empathy)

### Example Comment Structure:
```
Problem Acknowledgment: "Yeah, I struggled with this too..."
Insight: "Research shows that X happens because..."
Personal Experience: "What worked for me was..."
Soft CTA (if appropriate): "I'm testing a tool that addresses this - happy to share if you want to try"
```
