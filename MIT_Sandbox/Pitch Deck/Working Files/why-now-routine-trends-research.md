## Axiom Forge - MIT Sandbox Pitch Deck

*Focused Research on Routine Culture & Habit Stacking - January 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

The routine content phenomenon has created unprecedented demand for structured, science-based habit systems. The gap between consumption and execution represents Axiom Forge's core opportunity.

**Key Insight**: People are obsessed with watching routines but struggle to follow them. No app bridges "routine inspiration" to "routine execution."

## 3. The Consumption-Execution Gap

### The Core Problem

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Gen Z/Millennials consuming wellness content | **79%** |
| Users sticking with habit apps past Day 30 | **3-10%** |
| Failure rate for self-designed habits | **92%** |
| Users who watch routines but don't follow one | **~70%** |

### Why People Watch But Don't Do

1. **Inspiration Without Implementation**
   - Videos show WHAT to do, not HOW to build it into a system
   - No accountability or tracking mechanism
   - Motivation fades after the video ends

2. **Blank Slate Paralysis in Apps**
   - Existing apps ask "What do you want to track?"
   - Users don't know what habits to pick
   - Self-designed routines lack scientific backing

3. **Streak Anxiety**
   - Punitive systems discourage users after first miss
   - All-or-nothing mentality causes abandonment
   - No flexibility for real life

### The Market Gap
**Nobody bridges watching routines to doing routines.**

Current landscape:
- **Content creators** → Show routines, no execution tool
- **Habit apps** → Blank slate, no pre-made routines
- **Axiom Forge** → Science-backed routines + behavioral insights

## 4. Habit Stacking: The Dominant Trend

### Shift from Individual Habits to Routine Systems

| Content Type | Engagement Level |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Individual habit tips | Baseline |
| Habit stacking content | **3-4x higher** |
| "Full morning routine" videos | **6-10x higher** |

### Why Routines > Random Habits

- **300% higher retention** for structured routines vs. random habit tracking
- Users who follow pre-made templates stick **3x longer** than DIY trackers
- "Come do my morning stack" videos vastly outperform single-habit tutorials

### What Users Want

Survey data (2024-2025):
- **70% of potential users** prefer pre-made, science-backed routines
- **68%** want one-click activation (no setup paralysis)
- **62%** want insights explaining WHY habits work
- **57%** want flexible systems that don't punish missed days
