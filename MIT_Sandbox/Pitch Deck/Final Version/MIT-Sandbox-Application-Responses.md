# MIT Sandbox Application Responses - Axiom Forge

## 3.1 Problem/Need Addressed

Routines have become a cultural obsession, with over 70 billion views on routine-related content on TikTok alone. Influencers like Andrew Huberman, Ashton Hall, and Ali Abdaal have built massive followings around morning and evening routines, proving unprecedented consumer demand. However, a critical gap exists: while millions consume routine content daily, over 90% of people fail when forming new habits, and health and fitness apps see only ~4% retention at Day 30.

Existing tools fail users in four key ways: they offer no bridge from inspirational content to daily action, they present blank-slate interfaces causing decision paralysis, they create streak anxiety where one miss leads to total abandonment, and they only show users what they did without explaining why they succeeded or failed. This leaves a massive audience wanting to execute routines, not just watch them.

## 3.2 Proposed Solution

Axiom Forge is a habit tracking app built on three integrated pillars designed to maximize long-term user retention: Actionability, Understanding, and Momentum.

**Science-Backed Smart Routines** eliminate blank-slate paralysis by providing evidence-based morning and evening routine templates ready from day one, structured for specific goals including sleep, fitness, and focus.

**Deep Behavioral Insights** move beyond basic statistics to explain why users succeed or fail. The app analyzes habit correlations, identifies weekday patterns and trends, detects anomalies, and reveals which habits work best together.

**Top Performers' Mindset Pills** maintain motivation through daily wisdom from thought leaders and entrepreneurs, complemented by reflection journaling and quote archives.

This combination addresses the entire habit formation journey: starting with science-based structure, sustaining progress through personalized understanding, and reinforcing identity through daily mindset reinforcement. The app is currently a fully functional Progressive Web App validated by early adopters.

## 3.3 Who is Your Competition?

Axiom Forge operates in the global habit tracking app market, which is projected to grow from $13.1B in 2025 to $50.2B by 2035 at a 14.4% CAGR. Key competitors include:

- **Streaks**: iOS-only, no templates, insights, or journaling features
- **Habitica**: Gamified approach with generic templates and basic statistics only
- **Loop**: Decent analytics but Android-only with no templates or mindset features
- **Habitify**: Offers mood tracking and notes but lacks science-based templates and deep insights

Research shows that over 50% of users discontinue habit apps due to lack of personalization or overwhelming interfaces, while 44% switch apps after motivation drops following missed streaks.

Axiom Forge is uniquely positioned as the only app combining evidence-based routine templates, full personalized behavioral analysis, and motivational journaling in a cross-platform PWA. This integrated approach, built around a strict no-BS philosophy, directly addresses the primary reasons users abandon competing products.

## 3.4 Describe Your Team and Your Team's Strengths

I am a solo founder bringing a unique combination of consulting rigor, startup agility, and healthcare domain expertise.

At **McKinsey & Company**, I developed an intense attention to detail and structured problem-solving approach essential for building products that truly address user needs. At **FounderNest**, an AI-first startup, I gained hands-on experience building and scaling tech products, including navigating a deep business model pivot that taught me critical thinking about when and how to adapt strategy.

My role at **Teladoc Health** in M&A provided comprehensive understanding of the healthcare and digital wellness industry landscape. As an engineer by training, I bring technical capability to execute product development independently.

Additionally, I will serve as Teaching Assistant for the Healthcare Ventures course in Spring 2026, providing direct access to professor coaching and a ready pool of students to test and refine the app during its critical validation phase.

## 3.5 What Do You Hope to Gain from Participation in Sandbox?

Through Sandbox, I seek three critical elements to accelerate Axiom Forge from validated prototype to globally launched product:

**B2C Marketing Expertise**: Consumer tech product marketing differs fundamentally from B2B. I need mentorship on customer acquisition strategies, viral growth mechanisms, and effective social media marketing tactics specific to wellness and productivity apps.

**Critical Feedback on Gaps**: While the prototype is functional and validated by early users, I recognize there are blind spots in my approach. I want rigorous, honest feedback from experienced mentors and fellow founders to identify weaknesses in my product, business model, and go-to-market strategy before scaling.

**Prototype-to-Product Structure**: I need guidance on the operational steps required to transform a working prototype into a polished, App Store-ready product. This includes understanding the legal, technical, and marketing requirements for a successful public launch and establishing sustainable growth infrastructure.

---

## 3.8 Team Build-out

To complement my strengths in product development and strategic thinking, I am seeking to augment the team with two key profiles:

**B2C Marketing Specialist**: Someone with proven expertise in consumer product marketing who deeply understands virality mechanics and social media customer acquisition. This person should have experience building organic growth through platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Reddit, and understand how to authentically reach and engage wellness-focused audiences. Ideally, they would have connections to or experience working with lifestyle influencers.

**Technical Co-founder or Advisor**: A highly technical individual who can stress-test my codebase for scalability and security, and help develop the advanced premium features on my roadmap, particularly the AI Coach layer requiring LLM integration for personalized habit recommendations and data-driven summaries.

I plan to recruit through MIT's entrepreneurship community, Sandbox cohort connections, and targeted outreach to professionals with relevant consumer tech experience.

## 3.9 High-Level Business Plan and Path to Market

**Business Model**: Axiom Forge employs a freemium strategy with multiple revenue streams:
- **Free Core**: Daily tracking, dashboard, mindset pills, science-based routines, and basic analytics
- **Insights Pro** ($2.99/month): Advanced behavioral analytics including correlations and anomaly detection
- **AI Coach Layer** ($4.99/month): Personalized AI-generated summaries and habit recommendations
- **Content Packs** ($2.99/pack): Premium routine templates from influencers
- **Sponsored Challenges**: Brand-sponsored group challenges (brands pay $0.5-2/user)

**Path to Market (Next 3-6 Months)**:
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3)**: Launch within MIT communities and personal network through direct outreach and referral incentives. Target: 25-30 users
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 4-5)**: Expand to Boston-area universities with student ambassador program. Target: 25-30 users
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 6+)**: Scale through Reddit productivity channels, TikTok/YouTube content, and influencer partnerships. Target: 100+ users

## 3.10 Track Record for the Project or Team

My track record demonstrates consistent execution across research, product development, and content creation:

At the **McKinsey Health Institute**, I conducted health and fitness industry research that directly informed Axiom Forge's positioning and feature prioritization.

For my **master's thesis**, I built a similarity score system subsequently implemented by FounderNest as a production feature, proving my ability to deliver deployable technical solutions.

At **Teladoc Health**, I researched and evaluated over 500 health tech startups for M&A, developing deep knowledge of what differentiates successful digital health products.

At age 14, I created a **YouTube channel** achieving over 300,000 views within two months, demonstrating early aptitude for content creation and audience engagement.

As a **student athlete**, I achieved a top 200 position out of 10,000+ participants in the 2025 Cambridge Half Marathon. This personal story of discipline and routine optimization provides authentic credibility when attracting health-conscious early adopters.
