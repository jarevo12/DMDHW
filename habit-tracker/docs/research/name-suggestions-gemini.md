# App Name Suggestions (Swiss Brutalism & No-BS Approach)

Here are 15 name suggestions for the habit tracking app, curated to reflect the "Swiss Brutalism" aesthetic, science-based methodology, and no-nonsense philosophy.

## The Shortlist

### 1. PROTOCOL
**Why it works:** It implies a strict, science-based set of rules or procedures to be followed. It sounds professional, military-grade, and unemotional. It fits perfectly with the idea of "morning/evening routines" being a standard operating procedure for a high-performance life.
**Vibe:** Disciplined, Scientific, Structured.
**Availability:** **Likely Unused**. The term is generic, but no major specific "Protocol" habit app dominates the market.

### 2. MODUL (or MODULE)
**Why it works:** Draws directly from Swiss graphic design (the grid system) and Brutalism (modular architecture). It suggests that your habits are building blocks. The spelling "MODUL" (German style) adds that European/Swiss minimalist flair.
**Vibe:** Design-centric, Architectural, Customizable.
**Availability:** **Likely Unused**. While "Module" is common in tech, "Modul" as a standalone habit app brand appears open.

### 3. AXIOM
**Why it works:** An axiom is a statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning. It suggests that your daily habits are the undeniable foundational truths upon which your success is built.
**Vibe:** Intellectual, Foundational, Irrefutable.
**Availability:** **Likely Unused**. Common word, but no direct "Axiom Habit Tracker" leader found.

### 4. KONKRET
**Why it works:** Phonetically resembles "Concrete," the primary material of Brutalist architecture. It sounds hard, solid, and tangible. It promises real, "concrete" results, not abstract fluff.
**Vibe:** Hard, Industrial, Tangible.
**Availability:** **Likely Unused**. Unique spelling makes it very distinctive and available in this niche.

### 5. SIGNAL
**Why it works:** In a world of noise, this app provides the "Signal." It relates to the "Smart Insights" feature—finding the pattern in the data. It's clean, short, and implies clarity.
**Vibe:** Sharp, Intelligent, Clear.
**Availability:** **Heavily Used**. "Signal" is a famous messaging app. Using this name would be confusing and practically impossible for SEO. **NOT RECOMMENDED.**

### 6. STARK
**Why it works:** The word means distinct, sheer, or unadorned. It perfectly captures the visual identity of the app (black & white, acid green, no clutter). It implies a "stark" reality check regarding your progress.
**Vibe:** Minimalist, Bold, Honest.
**Availability:** **Likely Unused**. Common adjective, but as a specific brand for habit tracking, it seems available.

### 7. VECTOR
**Why it works:** In physics, a vector has both magnitude and direction. It implies that the app isn't just tracking *what* you do, but ensuring you are moving with force in the *right direction*.
**Vibe:** Mathematical, Directional, Kinetic.
**Availability:** **Moderately Used**. There are "Vector" apps in various niches (robotics, drawing), but a dedicated habit tracker might stand out if branded well.

### 8. ETHOS
**Why it works:** "Ethos" is the Greek word for "character" and is the root of the word "habit." It elevates the app from a simple "tracker" to a tool for character building and identity shifting.
**Vibe:** Philosophical, Deep, Identity-focused.
**Availability:** **Moderately Used**. "Ethos Daily Routine" exists on the App Store. Might be too close for comfort.

### 9. RIGOR
**Why it works:** It communicates exactly what the "no-nonsense" user is looking for: thoroughness, strictness, and demanding standards. It repels people looking for "easy" fixes and attracts those willing to do the work.
**Vibe:** Tough, Demanding, High-Standard.
**Availability:** **Likely Unused**. "Rigor" is used in enterprise performance monitoring, but not prominently in the personal B2C habit space.

### 10. FORMAT
**Why it works:** To "format" a drive is to wipe it clean and structure it. This app is a way to "format" your life. It also nods to the layout/design aspect of the interface.
**Vibe:** Structural, Clean, Digital.
**Availability:** **Likely Unused**. Very generic word, making it hard to search for, but also likely free of a direct trademark competitor in this exact niche.

### 11. ACTUATOR
**Why it works:** An actuator is a component of a machine that is responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism or system. The app is the actuator for the user's life. It sounds mechanical and precise.
**Vibe:** Mechanical, Active, Controlling.
**Availability:** **Likely Unused**. Very technical term, likely completely open in the lifestyle category.

### 12. BASELINE
**Why it works:** Science-based. You establish a baseline and improve from there. It suggests data, measurement, and a starting point for growth.
**Vibe:** Analytic, Grounded, Measurable.
**Availability:** **Likely Unused**. Common term, but no dominant "Baseline Habit App" found.

### 13. TENET
**Why it works:** A principle or belief, especially one of the main principles of a religion or philosophy. It treats the user's habits not as chores, but as the core beliefs they live by.
**Vibe:** Principled, Core, Dedicated.
**Availability:** **Likely Unused**. The movie "Tenet" dominates search results, but as an app name, it seems available.

### 14. SYNTAX
**Why it works:** Syntax is the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences. In this context, it's the arrangement of habits to create a well-formed life. It appeals to the "code" of living.
**Vibe:** Logical, Ordered, Linguistic.
**Availability:** **Likely Unused**. Tech-heavy word, likely open for a lifestyle brand.

### 15. KERNEL
**Why it works:** The central or most important part of something. In computing, the kernel is the core of the OS. This app handles the "kernel" operations of the user's day-to-day existence.
**Vibe:** Core, Essential, Tech-focused.
**Availability:** **Likely Unused**. "Kernel" is huge in tech (Linux), but "Kernel Habits" or similar would be unique.
