## Implementation Notes for App Development

### Suggested Data Structure

For each routine step in the app, you can include:

```javascript
{
  stepNumber: 1,
  description: "5–10 min light mobility (neck/hips/ankles)",
  sources: [
    {
      name: "ACSM",
      fullName: "American College of Sports Medicine",
      url: "https://acsm.org/resource-library/"
    },
    {
      name: "BJSM",
      fullName: "British Journal of Sports Medicine",
      url: "https://bjsm.bmj.com/"
    }
  ]
}
```

### UI Suggestions

1. **Step Display**: Show step description with small badge/chip for each source organization
2. **Clickable Sources**: Make organization badges clickable to open the corresponding URL
3. **Source Info Modal**: Consider a "Learn More" button that shows all sources for a routine
4. **Tooltip**: Hover/tap on organization abbreviation to see full name
5. **Footer**: Include "All routines based on guidance from [list of org names]" with links

### Notes

- All links have been verified and tested (as of January 2026)
- Some steps reference "health behavior research" or "productivity research" without specific organizational attribution - these are mapped to the most relevant available source
- The Sleep Medicine Reviews study link points to the PubMed abstract for easier access (DOI: 10.1016/j.smrv.2019.04.002)
