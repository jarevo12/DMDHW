There's no necessity behind it.
And the human animal the way we were created is when we feel pressure, we feel the necessity to get things done.
We can move mountains.
But when that pressure, like almost like a barometric pressure releases, and we don't feel the need to get something done,

And what is missing in you right now is hope." - "Mel Robbins — American motivational speaker, author, and inspirational coach"
"Here's to the crazy ones.
The misfits.
The rebels.
The troublemakers.
The round pegs in the square holes.
The ones who see things differently.
They're not fond of rules and they have no respect for the status quo.
You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.
About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.

Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do." - "Apple commercial"

But as soon as you step into it, you realize it was not that deep at all and you can keep walking through it.
And I just love that visual because a lot of times when it's like we have this anxiety around this big decision we have to make.

I want to do things well and I don't want to leave stuff on the table,

I don't think you're going to change." - "Mel Robins — American motivational speaker, author, and inspirational coach"
