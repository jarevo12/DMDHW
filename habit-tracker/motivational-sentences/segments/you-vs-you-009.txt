next day reaction and belief in the productivity was why you in here man you
in here to grow what thank guys think of where you want to be before you start
what is now hard man journey is too hard you guys start trying to file someone
else's past success you guys are days of confused you must travel your
individual past success someone else's past are even done it's not for you to
incorporate what you believe in make your own everybody want to know what I
would do if I didn't win I guess we'll never know let me tell you about a voice
not this voice but the one inside the one that whispers it tells me what's
right and what's not when to leave and where to go it's not Shakespeare it
does not speak in memorable lines my inner voice always gives it to me
straight tells me who my real friends are when to say yes went to say no
whether the person sitting next to me is the one I'll be spending the rest of my
life with or not sometimes that voice is crystal clear go stay right wrong
sometimes it nearly whispers don't let it drown in a noisy world because in the
end no man woman or howl the rhythm knows what's right for you always trust
your inner voice everybody has one view listen to it
