The single most important thing in life.
For me, I care about fulfillment.
If fulfillment is doing hard things, from the age of nine, from the age of 12, I was
telling my mom these things.
Like, I feel a sense of responsibility.
My childhood and whatnot, that has sprung up on me from a young age, I just need to
be responsible for people and things.
For me, fulfillment comes from that sense of responsibility.
We don't take a second to realize the purpose is always there.
The purpose never leaves us, because the very purpose is you.
You are always the purpose.
There may be another purpose, like being a seal or going to college or whatever, but
the main purpose in life is you.
Your laziness is something that has to do with you.
You're not connected to something deep enough.
You don't feel the necessity.
You don't feel the devil at your heels.
You don't feel the fact that you very well die tomorrow.
That will impel you to get something done.
There's no necessity behind it.
And the human animal the way we were created is when we feel pressure, we feel the necessity
to get things done.
We can move mountains.
You're lazy.
You know exactly what to do.
Exactly what to do.
Because even me, in my state of, I can't read or write, I knew exactly what to do.
It just sucks doing it.
It sucks to do it.
Most people, the bottom 80% are lazy and they're looking for an easy way.
They're looking for a shortcut to be successful.
And there are not, there aren't any.
But if you do something repeatedly over and over, you develop a habit.
So most people are in the habit of looking for easy ways to get the things they want.
To do anything successfully in life, you've got to want it as bad as you want to breathe.
And if you want it that bad, if you're willing to give it that much in life, when dreams
do come true, anything you want can happen and become a reality.
I believe that sincerely and I'll die on that thought.
If you think the price of winning is too high, wait till you get the bill from regret.
And that bill from regret is generational.
It's just a matter of what's important to you.
And what's important to you, for whatever reason, I felt like I didn't feel good about
myself if I wasn't doing everything I could to be the best version of myself.
If I felt like I left anything on the table, it would eat away at me.
I wouldn't be able to look myself in the mirror.
So the reason why I can retire now and be completely comfortable about it, because I
know that I've done everything I could to be the best basketball player I could be.
That's where it comes from for me.
You can't leave any stone unturned.
Nobody handed me nothing.
If you want it, go get it.
Stop telling your visions to other people, because they're not going to see it.
Why do you think you keep imagining opening a business?
Why do you keep imagining buying a house?
Why do you keep imagining driving a really nice car?
Why do you keep imagining getting rich one day?
Why do you keep imagining that?
Because God is talking to you.
He's showing you something that He has for you.
When I was a kid, I was wondering what's the meaning of life?
Why are we here?
What's it all about?
And I came to the conclusion that what really matters is trying to understand the right
questions to ask.
No more f**king around.
You want your life to be better?
I can't help you.
Lee can't help you.
Jorrogan can't help you.
Ari can't help you.
Lee, you can help you.
Grab your f**king balls, get a f**king notebook, and write down what the f**k you're going
to do this year.
And this is it.
You're not going to have these problems.
F**k the drugs, f**k the cigarettes.
It all starts f**king today, all right?
No more f**king excuses.
That's the f**king...
This is the year of the f**king soldier.
We're getting back what belongs to us.
And that's it.
A lot of people want to be successful, but they want to go to the club on Thursday, on Friday,
on Saturday, on Sunday.
And then on Monday, they're getting outperformed by everybody in the f**king office and they're
wondering, why don't I get to raising the promotion?
Shut your f**king hands up.
That's why, man.
Get to work.
Get back to f**king work.
It's time to get back to work.
Stop hearing yourself talk.
Get off the podcast.
Don't be on social media too much.
Cut out all the f**king noise.
Get back to the f**king mental lab, because that's where the knowledge came from.
Expand yourself.
Take yourself out your comfort zone.
Do not live in your bubble.
Put some more air in your bubble.
If you stay in your comfort zone, that's where you will fail.
You will fail in your comfort zone.
Success is not a comfortable procedure.
It is a very uncomfortable thing to attempt.
So you got to get comfortable being uncomfortable if you ever want to be successful.
Look, I love to sugarcoat this thing for you.
I love to tell you, look, you can go out here and get rich.
Do a couple of things.
That ain't happening.
You got to get real dog-ish.
You got to get downright funky if you want to make it.
Now like I was telling you before, if you want to be ordinary, you ain't even got to
listen to me.
Just go about your business.
If you think ordinary is cool, ain't no problem.
It's some really, really wonderful ordinary people.
But if you are sitting in this room and you have extraordinary aspirations, then you're
going to have to do extra.
You put extra on top of an ordinary and you come up with extraordinary.
It's no other way.
All men are created equal, some work harder and free-season.
I'm going to say it again because you might have missed it.
All men are created equal, some work harder and free-season.
My name is Hanh Mughraga.
I'm a mixed martial artist with the Old Man Filey Championship.
What is martial arts?
Martial arts give me a focus.
I don't know where I would be without martial arts in my life.
That's why I have to be so authentic and so real about my own insecurities, my own false
mind.
This being a f***ing up person, I'm not the best at anything.
I'm not gifted.
I'm just driven.
And it's all about trying to share that message with people.
This is all about, you know, I speak to a lot of people.
Find your impossible.
What is it you think is impossible?
You could never quite grasp.
That's what you go after.
You don't have a dream, man.
You're dead.
You only go as far as your dream.
That's it?
I tell that to comics all the time.
I just want to make a living on it and I'm like, that's all you'll do.
You got a dream big.
Yeah.
I think people say that because they're trying to be humble.
Yeah, but...
Universe doesn't reward humility, man.
You might be humble with everybody else, but you got to tell the f***ing universe,
hey, I want to be bigger than life.
If you give up on your dreams, if you give up on your dreams, what do you have left?
Nothing.
I can't live that way.
I wasn't born to be wrapped up in bubble wrap and a blanket and sit on the couch and
tremble as the world goes by outside my door.
I want the world to tremble when I go by its door.
So it's a state of mind.
All right?
It's a state of mind.
So learn.
Adjust what you can and then just embrace the rest of it.
We're all writing a book.
What's your book look like?
What does your f***ing book look like?
Your life is a book.
You got a bunch of chapters in your book, but when they close that book, how good was the
book?
How good was your book?
What was the ending to your book?
If the ending to my book can be so amazing because of all that was done.
We all like to take this four lane highway.
The easy highway has f***ing signs.
It has restaurants.
We all love that four lane highway.
We always step over the shovel.
And all I did was I picked up that f***ing shovel and that shovel, I made my own path.
And you may have big boulders and s***.
They may be getting towards the miles of the road faster than you, but going through
this path of life, this journey over here that you make yourself, that's incredibly
difficult when it comes out to the other end of them, there is some glorious s*** that
you can't even explain to people.
And we're afraid.
Bottom line is most of us, even the people who have all these theories and s***, it's
easier to accept the fact that I'm just not good enough.
I wasn't made to do that.
And yeah, some of us can't be LeBron f***ing James.
But I tell you right now, man, we can do a lot of s*** when it comes to this pure arm
guts and willpower and getting through s***.
We have a lot more with a lot more than we think we have.
From that day forward, I made a promise that I will give it everything I got.
I'm ready to die for what I had to succeed.
I have to give it everything I got.
That way I'm a winner no matter what.
The Mamba mentality simply means trying to be the best version of yourself.
That's what the mentality means.
It means every day you're trying to become better.
Every person has the ability to put one foot in front of the other.
One step at a time.
Right?
So like if you're saying, okay, I'm going to climb Mount Everest, you're at the bottom
of the mountain and you look up and you're going, I'm not going to climb Mount Everest.
Right?
But if you break it down into sections, it's just one foot in front of the other.
One step at a time.
Next thing you know, you're at the top of the mountain.
You can't stop.
You can't quit.
I want to be the guy that people look at.
I don't care if you like me or didn't like, I don't care.
But I said, this m*** girl's going to keep coming.
