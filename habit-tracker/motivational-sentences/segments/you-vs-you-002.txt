it is to be our own biggest cheerleader 10 years before I've heard it put into
words if you can be in a bad mood for no reason you can be in a good mood for
no reason there's a quote that I've fallen in love with the magic you are
looking for is in the work you're avoiding the magic you are looking for
is in the work you're avoiding supposed to be hard if it wasn't hard
everyone would do it the hard is what makes it great you need to just keep
living listen to the pain it's both history teacher and fortune teller
pain teaches us who we are way sometimes it's so bad we feel like we're
dying but we can't really live till we died a little count you don't get it
there's there's great joy in the grind great joy in the suffer it's totally
cleanses your body out man of any kind of hate makes you grow up what I want to
invite you to do what I want you to consider is that every single time you
go and do something hard that's the story you've told yourself that it's easier
said than done you know it's it's kind of hard to do that well it's supposed to
be hard look if growing stronger if growing stronger and building muscle
easy you'd have no reason to go to the gym you'd have no there would be no
growth if there was no challenge and I'm answering your questions every question
I'm answering I'm with you but in the back of my mind all I'm thinking about
is all the times I could have won those matches that I lost by not bringing my
best mindset you're haunted by all the opportunities that you missed by not
bringing your best at that time when you could have won but you didn't win
because you allow life to interfere with that one shot when you're sitting there
getting ready to serve for the match and your mind is not thinking about where
that ball place needs to be but thinking about your family this or this at work or
that at work that's greatness greatness is your recall on every single shot that
you missed throughout a 20-some year career every shot you can go back and
say I was here this person was in the red shirt there greatness is being so
aware of the time of life in the second that went by and you can recall like it
was yesterday greatness is being able to go back there not making that same
mistake again and being haunted by it there really are only two macro level
motivators that we have in life and that's pleasure and pain I want people
to understand is okay so if nature only gave you two things to motivate you
pleasure and pain why would you eliminate half of them and so most people
think that life is about avoiding the pain I'm here to tell you right now in a
very controlled fashion it is about really experiencing the pain learning
from it pain plus reflection equals progress failure has been achieved thank
God now the only place to go from failure is to win you have to achieve failure you
have to take it that far nobody wants to go that far it's too scary but you know
something I got news for you that's where winning is it always has been the
one thing I would tell them is and I would tell them to get a tattooed on
your arm like yeah and they would say it's supposed to be fucking hard you say
you are morally obligated to do remarkable things why well I think
partly because life is so difficult and challenging that unless you give it
everything you have the chances are very high that it will embitter you and then
you'll be a force for darkness and not good and so you know the fact that life
is short and can be brutal can terrify you into hiding and avoiding you can
flip that on its head and understand that since you're all in anyways you might
as well take the risks that are adventurous there isn't anything more
adventurous than the truth so why is that a moral obligation well if you hide
and you don't let what's inside of you out and you don't bring into the world
what you could bring and you become cynical and bitter you will start doing
very dark things not only will you not add to the world what you could add but
you'll start being jealous of people who are competent and doing well and work to
destroy them so that's the pathway to hell really the only way you're ever
going to get to the other side of this journey is you have got to suffer to
grow to grow you must suffer we're built to walk uphill and when you reach the
pinnacle of the hill you want to stop and appreciate the vision but the next
thing you want is a higher hill in the distance because it's from the uphill
climb that we derive our value and I mean this technically so almost all the
positive emotion we feel that's experienced in relationship to a goal
and so in some sense you want a goal that you can never attain right so you
can always move closer to the goal that recedes as you move towards it think
well that's frustrating it's like Sisyphus pushing the rock uphill but
it's not because as you pursue that goal you put yourself together and your life
does get better and richer and more abundant you want them to be above
everything you're doing so you can continually move towards something that's
more sublime and better that's what you are you're here to live not to not to
sleep everything worthwhile is uphill you see every dream that you've ever had
it's it's all up if you have a great relationship with somebody you you had
to work on it it's uphill if you build a wonderful business guess what it was
uphill if you've made the right decisions there they're not easy are they it's
uphill and the only way that you can go uphill is to be intentional nobody ever
accidentally went uphill you've never talked to a successful person and said
how did you get to the top of the mountain and then look at you say I have
no idea if they're at the top of the mountain they know how they got there
because they had to have effort it took energy it took time everything was well
everything worthwhile is up hill take yourself out your comfort zone do not live
in your bubble put some more air in your bubble if you stay in your comfort zone
that's why you will fail you will fail in your comfort zone success is not a
comfortable procedure it is a very uncomfortable thing to attempt so you
got to get comfortable being uncomfortable if you ever want to be
successful those I can't catch a break guys yeah get them the away from me I
can't I can't be around those guys I don't want to hear that I don't want to
hear that I don't buy it because everybody has bad breaks yeah I've had a ton of
bad breaks but you know what I did I stayed up yeah and I thought through it
you're going to lose sleep you'll doubt whether it'll work you'll stress to make
ends meet you won't finish your to-do list you'll wonder whether you made the
right call and have no way to know for years this is what hard feels like and
that's okay everything worth doing is hard and the more worth doing it is the
harder it is the greater the payoff the greater the hardship if it's hard good
it means no one else will do it I've done everything I've ever done a hundred
times there's no other way to do it and I've had a bunch of it he breaks
everybody has but you got to realize when you have those he breaks what that is
bro you got a can stop you got to stop with all those I can't catch a break
bullet all the time you're complaining you could be instead hustling you could
be instead chasing your dream you could be instead figuring out what you're
doing wrong trying to prove certain aspects of your life getting your together
reading a book meditating something
come on what's the matter with you tomorrow there is no tomorrow there is no
tomorrow what do you think most people get wrong about motivation they think
it's a permanent fix they think it's something that is a constant they think
that maybe once I get it I'm gonna hold on to it and that's the thing about that
I always talk about it's nothing is permanent nothing is permanent and a
lot of times you have to learn to perform without motivation you have to
learn before without purpose you have to learn to perform a lot of different
things and that's what people think they think I need to have this motivation to
work out to study to be better so if they don't have it just do it and that's
where you fail that's why losing in life is so important whether it's getting
dumped getting fired losing a game lose loss those feelings where things didn't
work out your way that's important because it lets you know this is the bad
feeling that comes when it goes wrong and you improve and then it makes the
good feelings of victory all the better you have to suffer you have to make that
a tattoo on your brain so when that hard time comes again you don't forget it you
want to be ordinary you ain't even got to listen to me just go about your
business if you think ordinary school ain't no problem it's some really really
wonderful
