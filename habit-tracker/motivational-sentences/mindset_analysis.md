## 2. Onboarding Ranking (First 10 Days)
*Strategy: Start with inspiration and possibility (Days 1-3), move to defining the "Why" (Day 4), normalize the struggle (Days 5-7), and finally introduce "tough love" responsibility (Days 8-10).*

**Day 1: Possibility**
> **"Here's the big challenge of life. You can have more than you've got because you can become more than you are."** — *Jim Rohn*
>
> *Reasoning:* New users are looking for growth. This quote validates their desire to "have more" (better habits, health, etc.) by linking it directly to the identity shift ("become more") they are embarking on. It is positive and empowering.

**Day 2: The Reality Check**
> **"Nothing changes if nothing changes, man."** — *David Goggins*
>
> *Reasoning:* Simple, punchy, and undeniable. After the Day 1 high, this serves as a gentle but firm reminder that downloading the app wasn't enough; they actually have to perform the habit today.

**Day 3: The Journey**
> **"You're going to look back at any destination and realize that it was a 99.9% journey and only one day of celebrating achieving the thing."** — *Alex Hormozi*
>
> *Reasoning:* Early abandonment often happens because results aren't immediate. This sets the expectation that the *daily grind* is the point, not just the result, helping to reduce early discouragement.

**Day 4: Finding the "Why"**
> **"One of the big thrusts for success is to come up with a strong enough why. If the why is powerful, the how is easy."** — *Jim Rohn*
>
> *Reasoning:* By Day 4, the novelty wears off. This prompts the user to reconnect with their deep motivation. If they can articulate their "Why" now, they are more likely to stick through the first week.

**Day 5: Overcoming Anxiety**
> **"Playing out the fear... that fear is a mile wide and an inch deep... If you actually take the step and realize that it's not that deep... you can keep walking through it."** — *Alex Hormozi*
>
> *Reasoning:* Users might start feeling "imposter syndrome" or fear of failure. This visualization helps them take a small step (doing the habit) even if they feel resistance.

**Day 6: Identity Shift**
> **"Yeah, it's crazy to sometimes think like, what can happen if we decide that that I am qualified. What happens when I decide for myself that I'm going to do something different?"** — *Alex Hormozi*
>
> *Reasoning:* Encourages the user to start seeing themselves as the *kind of person* who does these habits, rather than someone just "trying" them.

**Day 7: Consistency**
> **"But if you do something repeatedly over and over, you develop a habit. So most people are in the habit of looking for easy ways to get the things they want."** — *Brian Tracy*
>
> *Reasoning:* Marks the first week milestone. It validates that their repetition is working and subtly warns them against slipping back into the "easy way" (quitting).

**Day 8: Ownership (Turning up the heat)**
> **"If you don't change what you're doing and how you do it, nothing else will change."** — *Jim Rohn*
>
> *Reasoning:* Now that they are a week in, the message becomes stricter. If they aren't seeing results, it puts the ball back in their court to adjust their approach.

**Day 9: No Excuses**
> **"I've made huge developments while I was staying up until four in the morning... You can make huge developments... while you're doing a nine to five."** — *Chris Williamson*
>
> *Reasoning:* Addresses the common "I don't have time" excuse that usually creeps in around the second week.

**Day 10: The Ultimate Standard**
> **"People don't understand it is you against you. The only person that gets in your way is you. Nobody else, YOU!."** — *David Goggins*
>
> *Reasoning:* High intensity. The user is now "initiated". They can handle the direct truth that their battle is internal, setting the stage for long-term discipline.
